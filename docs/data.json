        "As a software engineer at Lexi-Comp, I was the designer and initial developer for their <a href=\"https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/lexicomp/lexicomp\">mobile pharmacology applications</a>. The first versions written were for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_OS\">PalmOS</a> and developed using <a href=\"https://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/>PRC Tools</a> on Linux. The server software was written in Java. I was also responsible for porting this application to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_PC\">PocketPC</a> (later renamed Windows Mobile), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry\">BlackBerry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.android.com/\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS\">Palm WebOS</a>.",
        "The initial project on PalmOS was probably the most challenging. The PalmOS PDB file format was simply sequential records of up to 64k each. There was no HTML component for rendering hypertext content for the data. To work around these limitations, I developed a binary hypertext format and used a slightly modified version of <a href=\"https://www.zlib.net/\">zlib</a> to compress multiple documents into a single PDB record. I also developed a downloader application in Java to keep the database files up to date and sync them to the device. Also during this project, I contributed a patch to the Linux kernel USB driver to recognize the device ID of the memory stick reader in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLI%C3%89\">Sony Clié</a>.",
        "After PalmOS, the next platform I implemented was Windows Mobile (then known as Pocket PC). This platform had a subset of the Windows API and HTML rendering so was a bit easier than PalmOS. I reused the server code, zlib compression, and downloader application but with a more advanced file format.",
        "In 2007 when Apple launched the iPhone we set about porting the application so we could have it on the App Store as soon as possible. We later added dedicated iPad support. This platform was yet easier to implement on due to a more advanced OS and built-in WebKit HTML and JavaScript engine and <a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org\">SQLite</a> database format. Android and Blackberry followed also using SQLite.",
